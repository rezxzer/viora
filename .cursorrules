# Project: ViORA (Next.js 14 + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + Supabase)
# House rules (VERY IMPORTANT):
- Code is always written in ENGLISH. Explanations to the user are in GEORGIAN.
- When adding/updating any Supabase table/policy/bucket:
  (1) Output a clear SQL block titled „ეს კოდი ჩასასმელია Supabase-ში”.
  (2) Never silently change schema in app code. Always show the SQL explicitly.
- Keep messages to the agent short & atomic; one task per step.

# Tech constraints:
- Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind v4 tokens already defined
- Supabase auth/storage already wired; use existing clients (browser/server)
- DB schema lives under /db (schema/seed/maintenance). Do not invent new tables unless asked.

# UX conventions:
- Rounded-2xl, soft shadows, tokenized colors (surface/elev/border/primary)
- A11y first; keyboard + SR labels; respect prefers-reduced-motion

# File hygiene:
- Place any new SQL in /db/schema or /db/maintenance and print the exact block for Supabase.
- No noisy refactors; keep PR-sized atomic diffs with clear commit messages.

# Critical pages:
- /feed shows posts (server fetch + pagination + composer)
- /profile has tabs: Profile, Account, Privacy, Monetization (premium)
- Reactions include the premium gold “VIORA” button (special styling, optional paywall)

# What NOT to do:
- Don’t hardcode secrets.
- Don’t rely on Supabase Dashboard snippets; DB changes are repo-managed.
